# Sloshing-Galaxies-in-the-Most-Massive-Structures-in-the-Universe

Please read the abstract and formula sheet before reading this section. An understanding of the goal project is necessary to understand how the codes are being used. 

The codes included in this repository were used during my project at MKI for Astrophysics and Space Research (the title of which is the title of this repository). The seperations code was used to find the offsett value of BCG - SZ and the more precide BCG - Xray seperations. The seperations graphing code was used to generate graphical representations of the off set value. Redshift and Mass values were also represented on a graph. 
In continuing research after finding out the top core values (offsett values), the next step was to look into galaies where there was more than one potential BCG.The duplicates code indetifies duplicate data within the master file data. These could be repeat values caused by human error, but most are a result of my picking two BCGs by eye in the beginning of the project. In clusters where BCGs selected were indistinuishable from each other in terms of mass and brightness, the mid point was taken. This code was included in the code meant to find the duplicates. 

For more information on the project itself and for more visual representations of what the codes are doing, see "Independent Study Presentation". I have create a visual guide of my entire project, including the brief learning experience I had abroad in chile.
